# Nexss Programmer

This is just a package for better naming convention and to keep versioning safer. . All sources are in the **@nexssp/cli** repository. In the near future we will be moving all code here, but for now we will keep both ways `@nexssp/cli` and `nexss`

Now you can use `!npx nexss`, and not `!npx @nexssp/cli`.

And installation is just simply as: `npm install nexss -g`
